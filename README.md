# Annotate

Annotate is a tool to help you _quicky_ create medium to large datasets for common machine learning tasks, without needing to find external annotators.

The app allows you to create multiple projects, from a single python file

Each annotation view supports
* Creating new judgements
* Batch annotation view
* Viewing / editing past judgements
* Viewing statistics on model training
* A model playground
